abstract: This paper presents FIDELIUS runtime system for secure cloud-based storage and communication even in the presence of compromised servers. FIDELIUS’s design is tailored for smart home systems that have intermittent Internet access. In particular, it supports local control of smart home devices in the event that communication with the cloud is lost, and provides a consistency model using transactions to mitigate inconsistencies that can arise due to network partitions. We have implemented FIDELIUS, developed a smart home benchmark that uses FIDELIUS, and measured FIDELIUS’s performance and power consumption. Our experiments show that compared to the commercial Particle.io framework, FIDELIUS reduces more than 50% of the data communication time and increases battery life by 2X. Compared to PyORAM, an alternative (ORAM-based) oblivious storage implementation, FIDELIUS has 4-7X faster access times with 25-43X less data transferred.
